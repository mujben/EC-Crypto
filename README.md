# Kryptografia - repository for cryptography project
This repository focuses on implementing the **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** algorithm in C++, along with its common applications such as **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman)** and **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**.

This project aims to:
- Implement core elliptic curve operations over finite fields.
- Build cryptographic schemes based on ECC (key exchange and digital signatures).
- Compare the performance and efficiency of our implementation with established cryptographic libraries such as **libecc** and **Crypto++**.
